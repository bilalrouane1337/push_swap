# push_swap

## Description

**push_swap** is an algorithmic project from the 42 curriculum. The goal is to sort a list of integers using **two stacks** and a **restricted instruction set**, while minimizing the total number of operations.

Only specific stack operations are allowed, forcing the implementation of **optimized sorting strategies**, **careful memory management**, and **efficient algorithmic design**.

This project strengthens understanding of:
- Sorting algorithms
- Stack-based computation
- Algorithmic optimization
- Linked list manipulation
- Memory management
- Error handling

## Instructions

### Compilation

make

This produces the executable:

./push_swap

Clean object files:

make clean

Full cleanup:

make fclean

Recompile:

make re

---

### Execution

./push_swap 4 67 3 87 23

Or:

./push_swap "4 67 3 87 23"

Or:

./push_swap "4 67 3 87 23" -95 -651

The program outputs the sequence of operations required to sort the stack.

## Usage Example

$ ./push_swap 3 2 1
sa
rra

## Algorithm Overview

The algorithm dynamically selects a sorting strategy based on input size in order to minimize the total number of operations.

* **2 elements:**  
  A single rotation is applied if the elements are not already sorted.

* **3 elements:**  
  A direct case-based sorting algorithm is used, covering all possible permutations with the minimal number of operations.

* **4–5 elements:**  
  The smallest indexed elements are progressively pushed to stack **B**, the remaining three elements in stack **A** are sorted using the optimized three-element algorithm, and finally the stored elements are reinserted into stack **A** in their correct positions.

* **More than 5 elements:**  
  A chunk-based strategy is applied. Elements are distributed into stack **B** in indexed ranges (chunks), reducing disorder progressively. Then, elements are pushed back into stack **A** in descending index order using optimized rotations, ensuring minimal instruction count.
